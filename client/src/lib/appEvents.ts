/**
 * @file appEvents.ts
 * @description Window events used to trigger app-wide chrome from anywhere in the
 * tree, plus the typed helpers that dispatch them.
 *
 * These live in `lib/` rather than beside the components that handle them for one
 * reason: the trigger and the handler are usually in different components, and
 * importing one component from the other creates a cycle (the sidebar opens the
 * palette; the palette asks the sidebar to check for updates). A shared module
 * breaks that without giving either component knowledge of the other.
 *
 * A window event is also the right coupling here regardless: no context provider,
 * no lifted state, and any component — or a test — can trigger the behavior.

 * MODULE_GUIDE — extended in-file reference (comments only; safe to read, never executed)
 * =============================================================================
 * **Path:** `client/src/lib/appEvents.ts`
 * **Purpose:** Dashboard module consumed by the React client, MCP tools, or desktop shell depending on deployment mode.
 *
 * ## Design constraints
 * - Local-first: no telemetry leaves the machine unless the user configures webhooks.
 * - Fail-safe hooks path on the server must never block Claude Code; UI mirrors that
 *   philosophy by degrading gracefully (empty states, stale badges, reconnect loops).
 * - Destructive flows stay behind explicit confirmation modals and server-side gates.
 * - Internationalization: user-visible strings belong in i18n JSON, not literals here.
 *
 * ## Remote data & SSH
 * Remote Data Sources let operators aggregate multiple machines. SSH entries describe
 * how to reach a peer dashboard; the global data scope (`dataScope.ts`) narrows every
 * scoped GET via `?sources=`. Health checks and import history surface in Settings.
 *
 * ## Observability
 * Prometheus scrapes `GET /api/metrics` (see `monitoring/`). Grafana ships four
 * provisioned boards (overview, sessions, tools, alerts). Native npm scripts and
 * Docker Compose profiles are documented in `monitoring/README.md`.
 *
 * ## Public surface
 * - `COMMAND_PALETTE_EVENT` — exported API; see TSDoc on the symbol for behavior.
 * - `UPDATE_CHECK_EVENT` — exported API; see TSDoc on the symbol for behavior.
 * - `ACTION_TOAST_EVENT` — exported API; see TSDoc on the symbol for behavior.
 * - `openCommandPalette` — exported API; see TSDoc on the symbol for behavior.
 * - `requestUpdateCheck` — exported API; see TSDoc on the symbol for behavior.
 * - `announceAction` — exported API; see TSDoc on the symbol for behavior.
 *
 * ## Testing pointers
 * - Prefer colocated `__tests__` with Vitest + Testing Library for UI.
 * - Server contract changes require `npm run test:server` and OpenAPI sync.
 * - MCP edits: `npm run mcp:typecheck` and `npm run mcp:build`.
 *
 * ## Related docs
 * - `ARCHITECTURE.md` — hooks → API → SQLite → WebSocket → UI pipeline.
 * - `docs/API.md` — REST reference.
